DELETING COLLECTIONS
***These commands must always be done with care or wrong data will be deleted***

DELETING A SINGLE RECORD
***WILL DELETE THE FIRST RECORD THAT MATCHES THE FILTER***

Just like with updating, there is deleteOne() and deleteMany() methods, which take 1 arguments
    1. The filter

    -  db.tours.deleteOne({rating: {$lt: 4.8} })

DELETING MANY RECORDS
Will delete all records that match the search criteria
    -  db.tours.deleteMany({rating: {$lte: 4.8} })

This will delete all records from the Collection as the empty object ({}) refers to all documents in the Collection 
    - db.tours.deleteMany({})
